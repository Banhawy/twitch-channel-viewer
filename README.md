# Twitch Channel Viewer

This is one of the front-end project projects by [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/use-the-twitchtv-json-api).

This SPA is built with ReactJS and uses [Twitch API](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/) to fetch information about seected online and offline channels, allowing the user to sort between them.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
